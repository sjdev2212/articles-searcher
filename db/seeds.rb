                             school, in Palo Alto,
    the name Silicon Valley was not in use beyond
    a small group of tech cognoscenti. Apple Computer
    had incorporated the previous year, releasing the first
     popular personal computer,
    the Apple II. The major technology companies made
    electronics
    hardware, and on the way to school I rode my bike
     through the
    Stanford Industrial Park, past the offices of
    Hewlett-Packard,
    Varian, and Xerox PARC. The neighborhoods of the Santa Clara
   Valley were dotted with cheap, modern, one-story
   houses—called Eichlers,
      after the builder Joseph Eichler—with glass walls,
      open floor plans, and
      flat-roofed carports. (Steve Jobs grew up in an
        imitation Eichler, c
      alled a Likeler.) The average house in Palo Alto
       cost about a hundred and
      twenty-five thousand dollars. Along the main downtown
      street, University
      Avenue—the future address of PayPal, Facebook, and
      Google—were sports shops,
      discount variety stores, and several art-house cinemas,
       together with
      the shuttered, X-rated Paris Theatre. Across El Camino Real,
       the Stanford
      Shopping Center was anchored by Macys and Woolworths,
       with one boutique
     store—a Victoria's Secret had opened in 1977—and
     a parking lot
      full of Datsuns and Chevy Novas. High-end dining
       was virtually
      unknown in Palo Alto, as was the adjective “high-end.”
       The public
      schools in the area were excellent and almost universally
      attended;
      the few kids I knew who went to private school had
      somehow messed up.
      The Valley was thoroughly middle class, egalitarian,
       pleasant, and a
              little boring." },

                             fall asleep, but her mind kept racing. Tomorrow
                             was going to be the culmination of three years of research and, possibly,
          a day that would change her life forever. Around four a.m.
           she popped two Benadryl and managed to drift off. But in just a few
            hours she had to be up and ready to go.
          Cheryl and her husband, Dickie, are retired, and live in eastern
           Virginia, way out on the end of the Northern Neck peninsula, which
           juts like an arthritic finger into Chesapeake Bay.
          It's a beautiful and isolated spot, where most people tack up
          “No Trespassing” signs and stay close to home. The Whittles enjoy
           their life in the country, but Cheryl was eager that day to make the long drive to meet Effie Jane.
         She showered, threw on a T-shirt, jeans, and sneakers, dotted
         make-up on her cheeks,
          and scrunched a dollop of mousse into her thinning brown hair.
        There's nothing showy about Cheryl, not even on a day like this.
         She's short and shy, with nine grandchildren and no pretensions.
         She grabbed a shoulder bag, heavy with the day's supplies, and
         kissed Dickie on her way out the door." }])
